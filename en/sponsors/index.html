The groundbreaking HTC Touch™ is equipped with TouchFLO™ so that consumers just sweep their finger across the screen to get access to the most commonly used content, contacts and features in a simple finger flick. HTC aims to continually develop smart new devices that empower users on the go, providing more freedom in the way they live their lives.</p>

<div class="sponsor_content"><p>Since its establishment on December 30, 1978, the Archilife Research Foundation has offered scholarships to support students in master courses to complete their theses, and implemented different ways to integrate knowledge. After long years of its pioneering stage, Archilife commenced various long-term researches in the areas of architecture, environmental sustainability and development starting from 1987. During the process of researching human inhabitations and sustainable development, Archilife discovered that advancements of information technologies and cyberspace over the past decade had profound impacts on human lifestyles. The sharing and integration of related knowledge, and the education in these fields should be one of Archilife's essential objectives.</p>

<p>Therefore, besides scholarships regarding architecture, environmental sustainability, ecology and health care, Archilife offered scholarships for the theses related to information society and culture from 2000 to 2008 as well. On the other hand, information technologies and the Internet brought new possibilities to how people can express their creativities and interact with each other. So, subsequent to recent adjustments of the scholarships and the funding projects, Archilife started with holding a series of sharing and exchanging meet-ups among the domestic independent game developers' community, conveying and communicating the knowledge and experiences learned from certain international game development conferences, in the hope that it would help this community to evolve.</p>

<p>About other aspects of knowledge integration, Archilife developed different methods including: a knowledge bank system, index books, and knowledge keepers in various fields. These resources have served as powerful tools in filling in research gaps and refining research findings. Archilife currently holds periodic communions and bookish assemblies to strengthen the knowledge of its members so as to face a heterogeneous and changing future.</p>
